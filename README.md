# Selenium-Scripts

These are scripts I created for selenium when I wanted to automate sock puppet activity and I asked ChatGPT to create a script to autmatically login to LinkedIn and post a motivational quote. They didn't work at all.  Weren't even close :)  They say it's the journey, not the destination.  It was fun pulling all this together when ChatGPT failed my laziness. There are probably better and more efficient ways to do this.

## Pre-Reqs
1. I run these on Ubuntu with Firfox and have Firefox clear history on close.
2. pip3 install -U selenium

## linkedin.py
- Automatically login to LinkedIn and post a random motivational quote from motivational_quotes.txt (included)
