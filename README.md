# Selenium-Scripts

These are scripts I created for selenium when I asked ChatGPT to create them for me and they didn't work at all.  Weren't even close :).

## Pre-Reqs
1. I run these on Ubuntu with Firfox and have Firefox clear history on close.
2. pip3 install -U selenium

## linkedin.py
- Automatically login to LinkedIn and post a random motivational quote from motivational_quotes.txt (included)
